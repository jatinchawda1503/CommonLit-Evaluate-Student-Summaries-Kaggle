Documentation for Text Preprocessing Function `run`\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `run` function is a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline designed to prepare and enrich text data for further analysis or machine learning tasks. The function takes in two data frames, `prompts` and `summaries`, along with a `mode` parameter, and returns a processed data frame with various linguistic and statistical features.\n\n---\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **prompts: pd.DataFrame**  \n  - A DataFrame containing the prompts with a column named `prompt_text`.\n\n- **summaries: pd.DataFrame**  \n  - A DataFrame containing the summaries with a column named `text`.\n\n- **mode: str**  \n  - The mode in which the function operates, although its specific use is not detailed in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n## Features Grouped by Cognitive or Exam Criteria\n\n### Text Length and Tokenization\n\n- `prompt_length`: Length of the prompt in terms of tokens.\n- `summary_length`: Length of the summary in terms of tokens.\n- `prompt_tokens`: Tokenized form of the prompt.\n- `summary_tokens`: Tokenized form of the summary.\n\n### Spelling and Grammar\n\n- `splling_err_num`: Number of spelling errors in the summary.\n- `gunning_fog`, `flesch_kincaid_grade_level`, `flesch_reading_ease`: Readability scores for both prompts and summaries.\n\n### Linguistic Features\n\n- `word_count`, `sentence_length`, `vocabulary_richness`: Basic text statistics.\n- `avg_word_length`, `comma_count`, `semicolon_count`: Additional linguistic features.\n- `pos_ratios`: Part-of-speech ratios in the text.\n- `punctuation_ratios`: Punctuation ratios in the text.\n\n### Text Similarity and Overlap\n\n- `word_overlap_count`, `bigram_overlap_count`, `trigram_overlap_count`: N-gram overlaps between prompts and summaries.\n- `jaccard_similarity`: Jaccard similarity between prompts and summaries.\n- `text_similarity`: Custom text similarity metric.\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\n- `sentiment_polarity`, `sentiment_subjectivity`: Sentiment scores.\n- `sentiment_scores`: Detailed sentiment scores, further decomposed into individual columns.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en')\nsid =

üìÑ LightGBM Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna: Professional Documentation\n\n## üéØ Overview\n\nThe script performs hyperparameter optimization for LightGBM using Optuna. It aims to minimize the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for a regression task. The script employs k-fold cross-validation and saves the best models for each target.\n\n---\n\n## üõ† Parameters\n\n- **boosting_type**: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (`gbdt`).\n- **random_state**: Seed for reproducibility (`42`).\n- **objective**: Task objective (`regression`).\n- **metric**: Evaluation metric (`rmse`).\n- **learning_rate**: Learning rate, optimized by Optuna.\n- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of the trees.\n- **lambda_l1, lambda_l2**: L1 and L2 regularization, optimized by Optuna.\n- **num_leaves**: Number of leaves, optimized by Optuna.\n- **verbosity**: Logging level (`-1` to suppress warnings).\n\n---\n\n## üìä Model Training\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create an empty dictionary `model_dict` to store the best models for each target.\n2. **Cross-Validation**: Loop through each fold and split the data into training and validation sets.\n3. **Optimization**: Use Optuna to optimize hyperparameters.\n4. **Model Training**: Train LightGBM models with the optimized parameters.\n5. **Evaluation**: Store the best models and their scores.\n\n---\n\n## üìà Key Functions\n\n- `lgb.train()`: Trains the LightGBM model.\n- `optuna.create_study()`: Creates an Optuna study object.\n- `study.optimize()`: Runs the optimization.\n\n---\n\n## üìã Logging Insights\n\nStructured logs can be incorporated to track the progress of each trial and the best parameters found.\n\n```python\nimport logging\nlogging.info(f\"Best trial: score {study.best_value}, params {study.best_params}\")\n```\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# targets = [\"content\", \"wording\"]\n\n# drop_columns = [\"fold\", \"student_id\", \"prompt_id\", \"text\",\n#
